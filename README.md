analysis on this data

New York City is a thriving metropolis, and like most other cities of its size, one of the biggest problems faced by its residents is the lack of parking space. The classic combination of a huge number of cars and cramped geography is the exact recipe that leads to a large number of parking tickets.

 In an attempt to scientifically analyze this phenomenon, the NYC Police Department regularly collects data related to parking tickets. This data is made available by the NYC Open Data portal.
